         <p> <span class = "inlinetext"> CortiBot is a late-reveal hormone tracking app via wearable sensors that monitor your health condition using AR gamification.  </span>Users can raise a robot and complete assigned tasks in augmented reality to keep the robot's well-being. From this app we use persuasive techniques to persuade users that their look on the outside is not what is considered “healthy”. How their bodies are maintaining homeostasis is more crucial to living a healthy life. From the data, the app determines whether you have appropriate cortisol hormone, sleep, hydration, and activity while not exceeding high bound and low bound. </p>

          <p>We have all heard this saying once, “You are what you eat.” With unreasonable beauty standards that Hollywood and celebrities portray through media, we have started to associate beauty and health with the shape of our bodies. However, we have misconceived notions on what is considered “healthy.” Health is not strictly based on how much you eat or how much exercise you get, albeit important factors. The hormones, or lack thereof, that you secrete is what defines you as a healthy individual.</p>

          <p>For this project, our team decided to create an intervention through either a mobile app or wearable that tracks and manages the level of growth hormones secreting in our body.</p>

            <p>Even with the growth and advancement of fitness-tracking technology, the belief that weight and thinness are accurate measures of health and fitness is still highly prevalent. Although this is partially due to the unrealistic standards set by the airbrushed images that dominate magazine covers, this is also partially because stepping on a scale is one of the most accessible, automated forms of body measurement. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that weight is one of the most common ways to gauge individual fitness. As a result, people still commonly hold and work towards weight goals, as opposed to goals of other measures.  </p>

            <p>The initial three approaches were: a gamification and data visualization-focused app, a pet robot app, and a physical product. All approaches included a tracking device that tracks cortisol levels, hydration levels, sleep cycles, and physical activity. In this approach, the goal was to learn how users would respond to persuasive attempts through data visualizations. We used an embedded design approach to convey the importance of tracking cortisol levels. A robot avatar interacts with the user, using metaphors to indicate what the user needs based on what the wearable is detecting.

                In this approach, the goal was to learn how users would respond to persuasive attempts through data visualizations. We used an embedded design approach to convey the importance of tracking cortisol levels. A robot avatar interacts with the user, using metaphors to indicate what the user needs based on what the wearable is detecting. For instance, the robot would alert the user, saying it is “low on gas” to indicate low hydration levels and suggest that the user drinks a glass of water.

              <p> The prototype was well-received during user testing, with participants commenting on how they liked the idea of delivering health data via an avatar and felt that the friendly competition aspect would also be a good motivator.During user-testing, participants commented that it is important for the user to understand what the robot levels indicate in terms of the user. The prototype used terms such as “CPU” and “Rust” as metaphors for the different types of tracked data, but participants took some time to understand what they were specifically referring to. </p>

             <div class = "secheader" >Learning from Users</div>



              <p> Taking the feedback each pair received during the paper prototyping stage, we combined what worked into a single paper prototype which we then transferred over to Adobe XD. In this version, the separate bars indicating levels of hydration, activity, etc. were combined into a single HP bar. There was also a separate statistic, experience level, that indicated how much you were learning through the application. The tasks continued to be presented as gifts for the user to “unpack” each day to find their daily tasks. Our statistics page was left simple with only a graph tracking stress levels. 
              </p>



              <p>Some users liked the intervention aspect of our application, but others suggested that we could make our tasks more challenging. For example, we could make users complete increasingly difficult tasks to capture gears. Currently, the tasks can be completed almost effortlessly, making the game too easy and less engaging. Additionally, some people suggested that we should incorporate more opportunities to interact with their robot to form stronger relationships and emotional attachment, especially given that our design relies heavily on this emotional bond for users to continue using the app. </p>

              <p> We decided to reframe our information hierarchy and then visualize them consistently. For instance, the task page would only have tasks with consistent title, content, and points. As we tested through the prototype with the user, we also realized that the order that we revealed the information according to the menu bar might not align with our intention. </p> 
              <p>We decided to change the order of the task menu and the track menu so that users can prioritize completing the tasks rather than tracking the numbers. This change would better serve our goal of the app. Finally, we realized the way we represented the metaphors was not providing sufficient information for users to understand the purpose of the app, and what actions need to be taken for each steps. Based on the user’s feedback, we decided to specify the components of the HP or Level.  </p>

              <p> After more user testings and iterations, we have finally landed on our high-fidelity design, which we incorporated feedback and results we received from testings.</p>

              <p> For high fidelity version of our design, we incorporated   <span class = "inlinetext">metaphor</span> techniques because approaches that are too explicit might trigger reactance:

              <li>Use obfuscation to hide health tracking purpose at beginning</li>
              <li>Distance users with the goal to make it more effective</li>
              <li> Metaphors may influence impressions of the communication source and thereby impact attitudes toward the communication topic</li>
 
               </p>

              <p>We want to help users <span class = "inlinetext">establish habit </span>by creating a psychological distance between self and stimulus by using metaphor


              <li>High level / abstract construals promote greater self control - help users keep the long view of goal pursuit in mind and shift focus to the implications of temptations that undermine self control</li>

                <span class = "inlinetext">Habit Formation with AR Gamification</span>
               <p>Provide repetitive tasks to perform behaviors. User should clearly identify the first time planning with details. Then, provide tasks.
                With <span class = "inlinetext">repetition of behavior</span> in a consistent context, automaticity increases. Thus, first time requires  planning, and this habit should be repeated in consistent settings to proceed more efficiently and with less thought as control of the behavior which leads to activate automatic response.
               Also, no longer term costs associated in a single omission. </p>

  
               <p> <span class = "inlinetext">Gamification</span> have a positive impact in health and wellbeing, particularly for health behaviours. We want to use gamification increase engagement and achieve health results.</p>

              <p>Clear goal is a high form of affordance, which is also strongly and positively related to Challenges.
              Users respond the best when they feel like they are in control.
              Setting difficult but attainable goals could enhance user’s performance.
              Different game element serves different psychological needs. Avatars, meaningful stories serves need for social relatedness and need for autonomy (decision freedom and task meaningfulness.

              <li>Track cortisol level with wearables. </li>
              <li>Use robot metaphor to represent the data, for avoiding reactance, and creating psychological distance, and gain more self control. </li>
              <li>Using repetitive prompt and context to help users form habits. </li>
              <li>Using gamification to increase engagement which includes finding gear, increasing engine, and adding oil. </li>

            <p> Based on our feedback from Demo Day, we saw that people generally liked our gamified health app and the idea of indirectly taking care of oneself by caring for an external figure. However, we also received several questions on whether repetitive tasks—such as drinking water, finding gears—could get boring after a while, prompting us to think of more diverse tasks to <span class = "inlinetext">keep users engaged </span> throughout their time with the app. Some users liked the AR game aspect of our application, but others suggested that we could make our tasks more challenging. For example, we could make users complete increasingly difficult tasks to capture gears. Currently, the tasks can be completed almost effortlessly, making the game too easy and less engaging.  </p> 

             <p>Additionally, some people suggested that we should incorporate more opportunities to interact with their robot to form stronger relationships and emotional attachment, especially given that our design relies heavily on this emotional bond for users to continue using the app. Many also commented that they will likely abandon the app if they see that they are making stagnant progress. </p>

            <p>We will <span class = "inlinetext">brainstorm features to integrate into our wearable devices.</span> We also want to develop a <span class = "inlinetext">reward system</span> to retain users in the case that weight loss progress is slower than expected. Additionally, we will look further into the possibilities of real-time hormone level tracking and make AR experience <span class = "inlinetext">more fun and challenging</span> .  </p>
