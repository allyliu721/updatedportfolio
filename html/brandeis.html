        <br><p> With the prevalence of sensor-based smart phone apps, mobile data privacy is getting more and more complex. Every moment in every day, our mobile device collects our data, and it is for sale. <span class = "inlinetext">How can we make sure our data on smartphone devices is protected and not used by third-party companies?</span> </p>

         <p> Our goal is to help users become more sensitive in their data and lead them to configure a personalized private setting based on their choice. We ask the app end-developers to list out and break down their privacy data request (such as location, camera, and contact list). Users will be able to see "what data type is being accessed", who is accessing their data", and "why is the data being accessed". While we categorize data by "Typical" vs "Atypical" base on the specific app category and give user default recommended setting, users will have the freedom to configure privacy setting based on their preference, such as blocking all third-party advertisers.</p>

          <p>With the prevalence of sensor-based smart phone apps, mobile data privacy is getting more and more complex.
          We live in a society which we are overwhelmed by privacy alerts and news every day. How do we protect our privacy data so it is used for our specific usage purpose only?</p>

          <p>The Brandeis Project is a collaboration between CMU, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" target = "_blank">DARPA</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies" target = "_blank">BBN</a>, and <a href = "https://www.invincea.com/" target = "_blank">Invincea</a>, with the aim to achieve an order of magnitude improvements for mobile privacy. Our goal is to recreate Privacy Manager and make privacy vastly transparent and easier for developers and end-users in the context of sensor-based smartphone apps. </p>


          <p>As the Designer on the team (advised by <a href = "https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/jason-hong" target = "_blank">Professor Jason Hong</a>), my role is to reimagine the UX and UI for privacy settings in a privacy - enhanced Android OS.</p>

            <p>If apps had clearer purposes (inferred or declared by devices), then we could create better predictive models of privacy concerns, which can scale to millions of apps and users. What we propose to Android is to ask the app developers to break down privacy requests, help users to recognize typical versus atypical data requests, and give them recommended privacy suggestions. </p>

             <div class = "secheader" >Understanding the Problem</div>

            <p>In current Android OS, apps tell you what permissions they are using (e.g. location, camera), but they don't tell you:
            <li>Why they are using these permission (e.g. for advertising) </li>
            <li>Who they are sending their data to (e.g. to third-party libraries like AdMob) </li>
            In this project, we are building a future in which users can know all those information.
  ​           </p>

            <p>Since we are redesigning the whole interaction of users with their privacy-sensitive data and the Privacy Manager, we have broken down the project into five parts: the Privacy Manager Home Pages, Install Interface, Configuration Interface, Run Time Interface, and Quick Setting Interface.</p> 

           <img src = "../assets/img/privacygoal.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"alt ="Brandeis" >


 
          
              <p><span class = "inlinetext"> Our Project shows user what the permissions are used for and who are the data being sent to.</span></p>
             
              <p><b>We want to make all the privacy data permissions transparent, help users configure the best privacy setting base on their preference, and at the same time, make the interaction as simple as possible under data complexity.</b> The detailed goals for each of the five sections are listed above. </p>

               <p>My design process for Privacy Manager breaks down into seven steps: Heuristic Evaluation, User Research, User Interview/Card Sorting, Sketching & Wireframing, Medium Fidelity Design, and Usability Testing. After several rounds of iterations, I finalize on the design and make it high fidelity. </p>


              <img src = "../assets/img/designprocess.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"alt ="Brandeis" >

         

              <p>I start from understanding the problem to Heuristic Evaluation on the current design. Then I dive into User Research where I could understand what users need and their pain points. After User Research, I conduct User Interview with potential users in different demographic groups to further get into users heads, so the  products could better serve users’ needs. </p>

             <div class = "secheader" >Learning from Users </div>


              <P>After user research, we divide our target users into three groups: the young millennials, the working professionals, the olders, and some privacy highly-sensitive groups such as the military.</P>

               <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/privacyusers.png" style = "width:110%; margin-left:-5%;"></img>
          


               <p>We found interesting <b>contradictions</b> that worth notice among users after the interview. While most of the users indicate that they rarely configure their privacy settings, they are also sensitive about their data. In fact, more than half of them don’t know that their information is used or sold to third-party advertisers. <b>Most importantly, they feel they don’t have control over their privacy.</b> </p>

               <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/privacyuserquotes.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%;"></img>

                <p>Not to our surprise, most users care about their privacy and how their data is being used. Nevertheless, most of the users indicated that the current Privacy system forces them to agree to privacy requests that they didn't want before they download any apps. The users are worried the apps would not function properly if they deny the data access. Most of them said that they didn't know what their information is sent or sold to third party companies.</p>

              <p><span class = "inlinetext"> Information Architecture</span></p>


                <p> In order to help us better understand the flow between each parts of the Privacy Settings, I have drawn out the flow diagram that shows the information architecture of the Privacy Manager, circumstances that will activate each section parts, and the connection among each sections. The detailed information architecture is shown below:</p>

                <img src = "../assets/img/brandeisflow.png" style = "width:150%; margin-left:-25%"alt ="Brandeis" >



                <p><span class = "inlinetext"> Medium Fidelity Design</span></p>


                   <p> The medium fidelity prototype includes Install Interface, Notification, and Quick Settings. For each sections, there are some iterations behind the current versions. For example. there are three rounds of Install Interface that have been presented below. The first iteration considered only to display all the information, but the second and third iterations brought up the new concept: "Typical " vs "Atypical" requests. The third version considered circumstances when privacy permission scales up and exceeds the current container box. </p>

    <!--       <div class = "secheader" >Iterate from Feedback</div> -->
          

              <p> My initial prototype focused on detailing privacy settings for different purposes and defining what data is being accessed , why the data has been requested, and who is trying to access the data. 
              </p>
              

         

          

              <h6>Made the simple design even simpler:</h6>
              <p> Instead of directing users to another page, I designed pop-up box on the same page, so users will have a less obtrusive transition. I broke down the problems into categories by listing out the Atypical Settings on the top, and collapsed Typical Settings for this app categorization. </p>



              <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/install1.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%;"></img>
              <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/install2.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>
               <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/designspec3.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>

              <p> First version categorizes permissions by “typical” and “atypical” settings. We wanted to add an “ask” option for users so the users can set permission settings only when the data is accessed at the moment. Users can click on the downward arrows to view more details regarding the specific permission.</p>
              <p> In order to help users make safer choices with their settings, we set the typical settings for the app category to be "on" and atypical settings to be "ask". Users can easily expand each setting category to see more details such as <span class = "inlinetext">who</span> is accessing the data, <span class = "inlinetext">what</span> data type is accessed, and <span class = "inlinetext">why</span> the data is requested. </p>
          
       



           
               <div class = "secheader" id = "reflection">Reflections</div>
                <p> In the next iteration, I will design how Global Policy (settings for all apps)affects users on install interface. There might be conflicting cases when a user sets location for Global Policy to be on, but the location policy for the specific app is "atypical". We need to inform users this specific case so they don't have conflicting mental models. In our previous version, I think the design is still a lot of text to read. I will do another round of user testing and work on simplying install UI. Furthermore, I will test on adding a recommended permission choice into the UI and iterate from the feedback. </p>

        <div class = "roundtwo" id = "roundtwo" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">
          <div class = "secheader" >Round Two</div>  

            

              <h6>Privacy Policy Home Page</h6>

                <p> Since we are designing the Privacy Manager for ALL mobile users, we want to <b>make the interaction as simple as possible while delivering all the information users want to know </b>. We need to make our design simple to use and easy to adapt for all age groups.</p>

                <p>We experimented the Card Sorting research method after the first round of design. The purpose for Card Sorting is to understand what information users care about the most when they configure a privacy setting. </p>

                 <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/privacycardsorts.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>


                 <p>After five rounds of Card Sorting, we realized that most users care about the “purpose” and “data type” of a privacy request the most. Users also tend to look at all the information together to see if their data is used properly.</p>



                
              <p> After users interact with Privacy Manager in the Install UI, We also want to allow users to come to Privacy Manager Home Screen to gain more knowledge about their privacy standing. They will have access for more detailed configurations at Privacy Manager Home Page.</p>


            <div class = "brandeisdemo">
              <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/oldhome.png" class = "column" ></img>
              <img src = "../assets/../assets/img/homescreen.gif" class = "column"></img>

            </div>

              <p> We examined the previous design for Privacy Poliy Home Page, and found the following problems that we could fix through Heuristic Evaluation:
                <li>Privacy Yearly Report is not a common feature that users access. The top section is usually utilized to position the most important feature or information.</li>
                <li>The purpose of the data trend on the home page is not clear. Six-month is too long for users to grasp their privacy overview. </li>
                <li>Engineers by category based on Android developer guide</li>
               </p>

              <p>We then did user testing on the prototype. After user testing, I received the following results:</p>


                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhome.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>
                <span class = "inlinetext">What Users Think</span>
               <li>Users don't know <span class = "inlinebold">why they need to change Privacy Setting</span></li>
                <li>Users don't know <span class = "inlinebold">how they can configure Privacy Setting the right way</span></li>
               <li>Users don't know what Privacy Overview and Privacy Rating were referred to</li>
               <li>Users think they need more context to understand the problem</li>

         

                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhome1.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>
                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhomev3.png" style = "width:130%; margin-left:-15%"></img>


                      <p> After user testing, I removed all the explanations for each section on the home screen to make the interface look clean. The titles should be explanatory enough for users to understand. Users can click in "view details" to get more information on each section. The "Atypical Permissions" will be highlighted at the Privacy Rating section. I also designed another version of interface when a user has malsoftware such as spouseware installed on the computer. User will visually notice on the home screen by both color and privacy score change. </p>

               <p>For user testing, I tried to recruit people outside of my network to receive more critical and unbiased feedback. </p>
               <p> To begin, I organized my digital prototypes into Invision to create a mobile mockup. I recruited one person from CMU library, one from Starbucks coffee shop, and two people walking on the street. I received a variety of comments during Think Aloud process, but I was able to find repetitive patterns from those information. One common feedback I received from testings was <span class = "inlinebold">Wow. That's a lot of information!"</span></p>

            <p> Our card sorting research shows that most of the users put data type/purposes as their primary concern, and they care least about user of the data. Based on this result, we designed a zoom-in effect for permissions, with which users would see the data type and purposes first, and can zoom in to see details and configure. Users would also be able to turn on/off/ask a group of permissions with one tap. The zoom-in design is applied to install UI, global settings and app settings in configure UI. </p>


              <p> For future iterations, I will work on on-boarding screens to walk users through Privacy Manager home screen and introduce functionalities for each section. I will also design detailed pages inside each section. Additionally, I will think more about content in the collapsed hamburger menu.</p>

            <p> We also thought that it would be helpful for users to have quick access to turn ALL the permissions for a specific category "On" or "Off". We did two iterations on the "Quick Settings" menu. The first one is to have "Quick Settings" collapse under the top navigation notification section. The second one will be closer to Android design which includes Quick Setting in one of the quick menus. We will do A/B Testing and Think Aloud Testing on these two iterations. </p>

            <p> Our project is still work in progress. I am always happy to chat more about my updates! :)</p>
