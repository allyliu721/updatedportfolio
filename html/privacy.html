         <p> There are moments when you walk in a store and you are overwhelmed by the amount of products and information. You enter with no idea whether they have clothes you want, and you don't know where or how to start. Sometimes you spend hours in a store, trying on a lot of pieces and you can't find one that fits you perfectly. </p>

          <p> Vuno is your solution to problems like these. Vuno recreates your shopping experience using Augmented Reality with assistance from AI. </p>

          <p>Vuno is an artificial intelligence powered assistance that utilizes Augmented Reality to assist individuals in their shopping experience to make both store navigation and garment selection processes effortlessly and effectively. Vuno implements conversational UI to help users set their shopping goals. Vuno extracts users' physical information such as body measurements in BWH, height, weight, shopping budget and find target stores and clothes that satisfy users' pre-set shopping goals. Vuno utilizes AR to forge an engaging shopping experience for shoppers to filter and absorb information with ease and efficiency. </p>

            <div class = "secheader" >Understanding the Problem</div>

              <p>"How can we enhance the current shopping experience?" In order to answer the question, I decided to conduct Contextual Inquiry research method followed by Semi-Structured Interview to take close observations on users' behavior during their shopping process.

              <img src = "../assets/img/vunousers.png" style = "width:100%"alt ="Current Privacy Manager" data-aos="fade-up">

              <p>After receiving consent from the stores and customers, I started observing users' behaviors and recording when new events are triggered. I made note on the time they spent on each task, such as "picking clothes on the same hanger", "walking around", "getting help from salespeople", and "trying on in fitting room". </p>

              <div class = "opportunity"  data-aos="fade-up" >
              <div class = "secheader" >Brainstorming</div>

               <p>while no research subjects are completely alike, one common result I found was that most customers spent around 60-85% of their time picking and choosing the clothes they want or trying on in the fitting room. Some of the users left the store when the pieces they brought in the fitting room didn't suite well. </p>

                <p>Since we are redesigning the whole interaction of users with their shopping experience, we have broken down the project into sixß parts: Find a shopping district, Find a store, Glance through the store, Find products, Try on products (repeat previous step if needed) and Check out.</p>

              <p><b>We want to make all the privacy data permissions transparent, help users configure the best privacy setting base on their preference, and at the same time, make the interaction as simple as possible under data complexity.</b> The detailed goals for each of the five sections are listed above. </p>

               <p>My design process for Privacy Manager breaks down into seven steps: Heuristic Evaluation, User Research, User Interview/Card Sorting, Sketching & Wireframing, Medium Fidelity Design, and Usability Testing. After several rounds of iterations, I finalize on the design and make it high fidelity. </p>

              <p>I start from understanding the problem to Heuristic Evaluation on the current design. Then I dive into User Research where I could understand what users need and their pain points. After User Research, I conduct User Interview with potential users in different demographic groups to further get into users heads, so the  products could better serve users’ needs. </p>

                 <p>For next step design, pen and paper are my best companies. I pulled out sticky notes and wrote down problems and opportunity identified, and then started sketching. There were many ideas that came out in my head, eventually I filtered down to these core features. </p>
