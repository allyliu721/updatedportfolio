          <p>Regardless of how busy we are with work, school, or life, we might feel lonely sometime at some point and we just need someone to talk to. 
          With today’s social or dating applications which take milliseconds to swipe and find matches, it has become easy to find quick matches, but . People come with strong intention or purpose, and it is hard to find someone who matches with your thoughts and who you can truly talk to. </p>

          <br><p>People often say “the dating apps have killed romance”. It takes milliseconds to swipe right. You don’t have much time to think through before you make a decision. </p>

              <p>Blur is a new social platform to find, chat and connect by showcasing your personality and interests before anything else. 

              Finding a match is as fun as playing a game on Blur - the photos of your potential matches are initially blurred, as you answer short and fun quiz questions, they become clear</p>

              <p><span class = "inlinetext">It’s personality first </span>  By answering simple & fun questions, you’ll meet interesting people and not make snap judgements based on a single profile photo.</p>
              <p><span class = "inlinetext">Privacy is vital </span>  Profile photos are blurred and only revealed to people that share the same value and interests.</p>
              <p><span class = "inlinetext">Make better matches </span>  Backed by advanced machine learning algorithms, Blur builds a comprehensive profile that makes better recommendations that fit you.
              </p>

             <p>As users enjoy answering fun questions to de-blur their matches, Blur is simultaneously building comprehensive profiles for them, so the more they play the better matches become. </p>

             <p>As the only designer on the startup team, I took a lot of responsibilities for all visual aspects. As past paced as a startup can be, I was in charge of wireframing, prototyping, user testing on each prototype at different stages, working with engineers to meet app updates, and assisting with any design-related visual needs for other purposes.

                <p> To begin, I organized my digital prototypes into Invision to create a mobile mockup. I recruited one person from CMU library, one from Starbucks coffee shop, and two people walking on the street. I received a variety of comments during Think Aloud process, but I was able to find repetitive patterns from those information. One common feedback I received from testings was <span class = "inlinebold">Wow. That's a lot of information!"</span></p>

              <h6>Made the simple design even simpler</h6>
              <p> Instead of directing users to another page, I designed pop-up box on the same page, so users will have a less obtrusive transition. I broke down the problems into categories by listing out the Atypical Settings on the top, and collapsed Typical Settings for this app categorization. </p>



              <img src = "../assets/img/install1.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>
              <img src = "../assets/img/install2.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>

              <p> First version categorizes permissions by “typical” and “atypical” settings. We wanted to add an “ask” option for users so the users can set permission settings only when the data is accessed at the moment. Users can click on the downward arrows to view more details regarding the specific permission.</p>
              <p> In order to help users make safer choices with their settings, we set the typical settings for the app category to be "on" and atypical settings to be "ask". Users can easily expand each setting category to see more details such as <span class = "inlinetext">who</span> is accessing the data, <span class = "inlinetext">what</span> data type is accessed, and <span class = "inlinetext">why</span> the data is requested. </p>
          
       



           
               <div class = "secheader" id = "reflection">Reflections</div>
                <p> In the next iteration, I will design how Global Policy (settings for all apps)affects users on install interface. There might be conflicting cases when a user sets location for Global Policy to be on, but the location policy for the specific app is "atypical". We need to inform users this specific case so they don't have conflicting mental models. In our previous version, I think the design is still a lot of text to read. I will do another round of user testing and work on simplying install UI. Furthermore, I will test on adding a recommended permission choice into the UI and iterate from the feedback. </p>

        </div>


        <div class = "roundtwo" id = "roundtwo" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">
          <div class = "secheader" >Round Two</div>   
            

              <h6>Privacy Policy Home Page</h6>
              <p> From Install Interface to Privacy Policy Home Page </p>
            
              <p> After users interact with Privacy Manager in the Install UI, We also want to allow users to come to Privacy Manager Home Screen to gain more knowledge about their privacy standing. They will have access for more detailed configurations at Privacy Manager Home Page.</p>

              <p> We examined the previous design for Privacy Poliy Home Page, and found the following problems that we could fix through Heuristic Evaluation:
                <li>Privacy Yearly Report is not a common feature that users access. The top section is usually utilized to position the most important feature or information.</li>
                <li>The purpose of the data trend on the home page is not clear. Six-month is too long for users to grasp their privacy overview. </li>
                <li>Engineers by category based on Android developer guide</li>
               </p>

              <p>We then did user testing on the prototype. After user testing, I received the following results:</p>


                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhome.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>
                <span class = "inlinetext">What Users Think</span>
               <li>Users don't know <span class = "inlinebold">why they need to change Privacy Setting</span></li>
                <li>Users don't know <span class = "inlinebold">how they can configure Privacy Setting the right way</span></li>
               <li>Users don't know what Privacy Overview and Privacy Rating were referred to</li>
               <li>Users think they need more context to understand the problem</li>
                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhome1.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>
                <img src = "../assets/img/privacyhomev3.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>
                <p> After user testing, I removed all the explanations for each section on the home screen to make the interface look clean. The titles should be explanatory enough for users to understand. Users can click in "view details" to get more information on each section. The "Atypical Permissions" will be highlighted at the Privacy Rating section. I also designed another version of interface when a user has malsoftware such as spouseware installed on the computer. User will visually notice on the home screen by both color and privacy score change. </p>

                <p> For future iterations, I will work on on-boarding screens to walk users through Privacy Manager home screen and introduce functionalities for each section. I will also design detailed pages inside each section. Additionally, I will think more about content in the collapsed hamburger menu.</p>
        </div>


           

        <div class = "moredesign" id = "moredesign" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">
          <div class = "secheader" >More Design</div>   
           
            <img src = "../assets/img/quicksettings.png" style = "width:100%;"></img>
            
            <p> We also thought that it would be helpful for users to have quick access to turn ALL the permissions for a specific category "On" or "Off". We did two iterations on the "Quick Settings" menu. The first one is to have "Quick Settings" collapse under the top navigation notification section. The second one will be closer to Android design which includes Quick Setting in one of the quick menus. We will do A/B Testing and Think Aloud Testing on these two iterations. </p>

             <p> Our project is still work in progress. I am always happy to chat more about my progress and updates :)!</p>
