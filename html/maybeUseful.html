          <p>With the prevalence of sensor-based smart phone apps, mobile data privacy is getting more and more complex.
          We live in a society which we are overwhelmed by privacy alerts and news every day. How do we protect our privacy data so it is used for our specific usage purpose only?</p>

          <p>The Brandeis Project is a collaboration between CMU, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA" target = "_blank">DARPA</a>, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBN_Technologies" target = "_blank">BBN</a>, and <a href = "https://www.invincea.com/" target = "_blank">Invincea</a>, with the aim to achieve an order of magnitude improvements for mobile privacy. Our goal is to recreate Privacy Manager and make privacy vastly transparent and easier for developers and end-users in the context of sensor-based smartphone apps. </p>


          <p>As the Designer on the team (advised by <a href = "https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/jason-hong" target = "_blank">Professor Jason Hong</a>), my role is to reimagine the UX and UI for privacy settings in a privacy - enhanced Android OS.</p>

              <div class = "secheader">I. Install UI</div>
              <p> Install UI allows detailed breakdown configurations which categorize all permissions by "Typical" vs "Atypical" Permission based on the specific app category. User is able to see recommended setting from back-end data. He is able to configure privacy setting by "On", "Ask", and "Off" three options and "who is accessing the data", "what data is requested", "why is the data being accessed" from permission request. </p>

                <div class = "secheader">II. Privacy Home</div>
                <p> User can capture privacy overview through re-defined Privacy Manager home page. User can browse through data access in a specific day, weekly trend or even more. </p>

              <div class = "secheader">III. Run Time UI</div>
              <p> Run Time UI shows detailed permission request by identifying "who is using the data", "what the data is used for", and "why is the data being accessed" from the permission during app run time.</p>

                <div class = "secheader">IV. Quick Setting UI</div>
                <p> Quick Setting allows user to turn ALL app permission on hardware for a specific setting (such as Coarse Location) "On" or "Off" at simple one click in the quick setting menu. </p>

            <p>If apps had clearer purposes (inferred or declared by devices), then we could create better predictive models of privacy concerns, which can scale to millions of apps and users. What we propose to Android is to ask the app developers to break down privacy requests, help users to recognize typical versus atypical data requests, and give them recommended privacy suggestions. </p>
